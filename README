NAME
    Jifty::DBI - Encapsulate SQL queries and rows in simple perl
    objects

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an object-oriented mechanism for retrieving and
    updating data in a DBI-accesible database.

INSTALLATION
    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test   # but see below for how to actually test against a test database
    # make install

TESTING
    In order to test most of the features of "Jifty::DBI::Collection", you need
    to provide "make test" with a test database. For each DBI driver that
    you would like to test, set the environment variables "SB_TEST_FOO",
    "SB_TEST_FOO_USER", and "SB_TEST_FOO_PASS" to a database name, database
    username, and database password, where "FOO" is the driver name in all
    uppercase. You can test as many drivers as you like. (The appropriate
    "DBD::" module needs to be installed in order for the test to work.)
    Note that the "SQLite" driver will automatically be tested if
    "DBD::Sqlite" is installed, using a temporary file as the database. For
    example:

      SB_TEST_MYSQL=test SB_TEST_MYSQL_USER=root SB_TEST_MYSQL_PASS=foo \
        SB_TEST_PG=test SB_TEST_PG_USER=postgres  make test
