NAME
    Jifty::DBI - An object-relational mapper

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an object-oriented mechanism for retrieving and
    updating data in a DBI-accesible database. 
    
    This module is the direct descendent of DBIx::SearchBuilder. If you're familiar
    with SearchBuilder, Jifty::DBI should be quite familiar to you.

    Jifty::DBI was forked from SearchBuilder to give us the opportunity to seriously
    clean up the API and internals without breaking existing applications.

INSTALLATION

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test   # but see below for how to actually test against a test database
    # make install

TESTING

    In order to test most of the features of Jifty::DBI, you need
    to provide "make test" with a test database. For each DBI driver that
    you would like to test, set the environment variables "JDBI_TEST_FOO",
    "JDBI_TEST_FOO_USER", and "JDBI_TEST_FOO_PASS" to a database name, database
    username, and database password, where "FOO" is the driver name in all
    uppercase. You can test as many drivers as you like. (The appropriate
    "DBD::" module needs to be installed in order for the test to work.)
    Note that the "SQLite" driver will automatically be tested if
    "DBD::Sqlite" is installed, using a temporary file as the database. For
    example:

      JDBI_TEST_MYSQL=test JDBI_TEST_MYSQL_USER=root JDBI_TEST_MYSQL_PASS=foo \
        JDBI_TEST_PG=test JDBI_TEST_PG_USER=postgres  make test
