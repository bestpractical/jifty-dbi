This directory contains Debian packaging files for Jifty::DBI.

It is currently at a very early stage of development and is hardly
tested.

I have Built it under Ubuntu Dapper with two perl modules from Edgy.
Another two modules were built from cpan using dh-make-perl.

A more complete list of instructions will follow and I'll probably
host a apt repository until such time as sufficient packages exist in
mainstream Debian or Ubuntu to install without any other packages
being required.
