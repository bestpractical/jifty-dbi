=head1 NAME

Jifty::DBI::Filter - base class for Jifty::DBI filters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # To implement your own filter
  package MyApp::Filter::Uppercase;
  use base qw/ Jifty::DBI::Filter /;

  # Setup for DB storage, store in lowercase
  sub encode {
      my $self = shift;

      my $value_ref = $self->value_ref;
      return unless defined $$value_ref; # don't blow up on undef

      $$value_ref = lc $$value_ref;
  }

  # Setup for Perl code to use, always sees uppercase
  sub decode {
      my $self = shift;

      my $value_ref = $self->value_ref;
      return unless defined $$value_ref; # don't blow up on undef

      $$value_ref = uc $$value_ref;
  }

  # To use a filter
  use MyApp::Record schema {
      column filtered =>
          type is 'text',
          filters are qw/ MyApp::Filter::Uppercase /;
  };


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A filter allows Jifty::DBI models to tweak data prior to being stored and/or loaded. This is useful for marshalling and unmarshalling complex objects.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Takes two arguments in a parameter hash:

=over

=item value_ref

A reference to the current value you're going to be
massaging. C<encode> works in place, massaging whatever value_ref
refers to.

=item column

A L<Jifty::DBI::Column> object, whatever sort of column we're working
with here.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args  = (
        column    => undef,
        value_ref => undef,
        @_
    );
    my $self = {};
    bless $self, $class;

    for ( keys %args ) {
        if ( $self->can($_) ) {
            $self->$_( $args{$_} );
        }

    }

    return ($self);

}

=head2 encode

C<encode> takes data that users are handing to us and marshals it into
a form suitable for sticking it in the database. This could be anything
from flattening a L<DateTime> object into an ISO date to making sure
that data is utf8 clean.

=cut

sub encode {

}

=head2 decode

C<decode> takes data that the database is handing back to us and gets
it into a form that's OK to hand back to the user. This could be
anything from flattening a L<DateTime> object into an ISO date to
making sure that data is utf8 clean.

sub decode {

}
