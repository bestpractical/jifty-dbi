=head2 encode

C<encode> takes data that users are handing to us and marshals it into
a form suitable for sticking it in the database. This could be anything
from flattening a L<DateTime> object into an ISO date to making sure
that data is utf8 clean.

=head2 decode

C<decode> takes data that the database is handing back to us and gets it into a form that's OK to hand back to the user. This could be anything
from flattening a L<DateTime> object into an ISO date to making sure
that data is utf8 clean.
