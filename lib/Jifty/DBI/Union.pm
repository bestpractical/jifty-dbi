# This could inherit from Jifty::DBI, but there are _a lot_
# of things in Jifty::DBI that we don't want, like Limit and

# Jifty::DBI::Collection to contain all the iterator logic.
# This could inherit from that.

=head1 NAME

Jifty::DBI::Union - Deal with multiple SearchBuilder result sets as one

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Jifty::DBI::Union;
  my $U = new Jifty::DBI::Union;
  $U->add( $tickets1 );
  $U->add( $tickets2 );

  $U->GotoFirstItem;
  while (my $z = $U->Next) {
    printf "%5d %30.30s\n", $z->Id, $z->Subject;
  }

=head1 WARNING

This module is still experimental.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements a subset of the Jifty::DBI collection methods, but
enough to do iteration over a bunch of results.  Useful for displaying
the results of two unrelated searches (for the same kind of objects)
in a single list.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Create a new Jifty::DBI::Union object.  No arguments.

=cut

sub new {
    bless {
        data  => [],
        curp  => 0,       # current offset in data
        item  => 0,       # number of indiv items from First
        count => undef,
        },
        shift;
}

=head2 add $sb

Add a searchbuilder result (collection) to the Union object.

It must be the same type as the first object added.

=cut

sub add {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $newobj = shift;

    unless ( @{ $self->{data} } == 0
        || ref($newobj) eq ref( $self->{data}[0] ) )
    {
        die
            "All elements of a Jifty::DBI::Union must be of the same type.  Looking for a "
            . ref( $self->{data}[0] ) . ".";
    }

    $self->{count} = undef;
    push @{ $self->{data} }, $newobj;
}

=head2 First

Return the very first element of the Union (which is the first element
of the first Collection).  Also reset the current pointer to that
element.

=cut

sub First {
    my $self = shift;

    die "No elements in Jifty::DBI::Union"
        unless @{ $self->{data} };

    $self->{curp} = 0;
    $self->{item} = 0;
    $self->{data}[0]->First;
}

=head2 Next

Return the next element in the Union.

=cut

sub Next {
    my $self = shift;

    return undef unless defined $self->{data}[ $self->{curp} ];

    my $cur = $self->{data}[ $self->{curp} ];
    if ( $cur->_ItemsCounter == $cur->Count ) {

        # move to the next element
        $self->{curp}++;
        return undef unless defined $self->{data}[ $self->{curp} ];
        $cur = $self->{data}[ $self->{curp} ];
        $self->{data}[ $self->{curp} ]->GotoFirstItem;
    }
    $self->{item}++;
    $cur->Next;
}

=head2 Last

Returns the last item

=cut

sub Last {
    die "Last doesn't work right now";
    my $self = shift;
    $self->GotoItem( ( $self->Count ) - 1 );
    return ( $self->Next );
}

=head2 Count

Returns the total number of elements in the Union'ed Collection

=cut

sub Count {
    my $self = shift;
    my $sum  = 0;

    # cache the results
    return $self->{count} if defined $self->{count};

    $sum += $_->Count for ( @{ $self->{data} } );

    $self->{count} = $sum;

    return $sum;
}

=head2 GotoFirstItem

Starts the recordset counter over from the first item. the next time
you call Next, you'll get the first item returned by the database, as
if you'd just started iterating through the result set.

=cut

sub GotoFirstItem {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->GotoItem(0);
}

sub GotoItem {
    my $self = shift;
    my $item = shift;

    die "We currently only support going to the First item"
        unless $item == 0;

    $self->{curp} = 0;
    $self->{item} = 0;
    $self->{data}[0]->GotoItem(0);

    return $item;
}

=head2 IsLast

Returns true if the current row is the last record in the set.

=cut

sub IsLast {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->{item} == $self->Count ? 1 : undef;
}

=head2 ItemsArrayRef

Return a refernece to an array containing all objects found by this search.

Will destroy any positional state.

=cut

sub ItemsArrayRef {
    my $self = shift;

    return [] unless $self->Count;

    $self->GotoFirstItem();
    my @ret;
    while ( my $r = $self->Next ) {
        push @ret, $r;
    }

    return \@ret;
}
