Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::SearchBuilder.

1.27 Sun May  8 22:49:30 EDT 2005

    - Added supoprt for functions containing "?" to represent the parameter 
        in ->Column()
    - Added better support for functional columns in search listings and
      group by clauses

1.26 Sun Apr 17 19:22:23 EDT 2005
    - Added support for expression based left joins


1.25 Sat Apr  9 12:33:30 EDT 2005

    - Backed out a change introduced in 1.23 that caused table and column names
      to be quoted, causing Postgres to flip out.

1.24 Wed Apr  6 22:54:37 EDT 2005
    - Added a new "SearchBuilder::Unique" module for uniquifying search results

1.23
    - Now use DBI->quote_identifier to quote column and table names (Ruslan)
    - Test suite updates (Ruslan)

1.22 Mon Jan 24 07:42:46 EST 2005
    - Require encode since we require encode.

1.21
    - Oracle LOB handling caused us to corrupt item values on update.
    - Just before inserting things into the database, turn off their utf8 flag.
      The flag didn't have any positve impact _and_ it can take down
      recent DBD::Oracle releases. (This is a new failure in DBD::Oracle 1.16)


1.20 Tue Jan 18 08:24:15 EST 2005
    - Minor test suite fixes from Ruslan.

1.19 Sat Jan  8 18:22:59 EST 2005

    - Performing a search multiple times could result in multiple copies of 
      records in a collection. Uncovered thanks to Kevin Chen and Alex Vandiver.

1.18
    - Release the changes from 1.17

1.17_03
    - Properly mark BLOB columns in UPDATE calls. (DBD::Oracle 1.16 broke without this)

1.17_02
    - Better handling of empty values for SB::Record::_Accessible. ( --Ruslan)


1.17_01
    - More record tests from Ruz

1.16 Thu Dec  9 23:49:39 EST 2004
    - Fixed a bug in D::SB::R::Cachable that could cause it to load the wrong row from the cache if you were loading 
      by alternate keys and had since changed one of the attributes of a previous row.  This was unmasked by a 
      bug that Ruslan Zakirov found in RT 3.3's custom field handling


1.15 Sat Nov 27 13:09:56 EST 2004
    - Fix a testsuite bug when DBD::SQLite isn't there


1.14
    - Silenced warnings about uninitialized warnings when inserting null cols
      into the database.
    - Started adding lowercase method name aliases
    - Minor refactoring of 'id' method for a stupid, tiny perf improvement
    - Refactoring of DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable for performance
      improvement
    - Added a FlushCache method to DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable.
    - Started to flesh out a...test suite
    - SearchBuilder now truncates strings before inserting them into character
      types in the database as mysql generally does. Additionally, it truncates
      things at utf8 character boundaries...as mysql does not.
    - Fix for an undefined record cache warning on load from Autrijus Tang    
    - Major documentation cleanups --Simon Cavalletto
    - A few tweaks to the ::Record class to eliminate the              
      hard-coding of the name of the id column --Simon Cavalletto

1.12
    - Better error handling for some query build failure cases
    - Corrected query builder for SQLite
    - More refactoring.

1.11

    - When loading an object whose "id" has been altered, as in the case of RT's 
      "Merge" functionality, the wrong object was returned by the caching layer. 
       Special casing for the "id" method was removed.


1.10

    - Identical to 1.10_05


1.10_05

    -   Reworked the _Accessible mechanism in DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record to 
        remove a horribly crufty old caching mechanism that created a copy
        of the accessible hash for each and every object instantiated,
        sometimes quite slowly.


1.10_04 Mon Aug 30 17:33:18 EDT 2004


A query builder fix for an issue that bit RT2: 

 Unsatisfied dependency chain in Joins Users_2 at /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder/Handle.pm line 965,  line 69.

Stack:
  [/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder/Handle.pm:965]
  [/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder.pm:326]
  [/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder.pm:119]
  [/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder.pm:410]


1.10_03 Mon Aug 30 14:31:10 EDT 2004
        - Cache Sanity fixes from Autrijus Tang <autrijus@autrijus.org>

1.10_02 Thu Aug 26 13:31:13 EDT 2004

1.10_01 Thu Aug 26 00:08:31 EDT 2004
        - Reimplemented DBIx::SearchBuilder:::Record::Cachable
          to use Cache::Simple::TimedExpiry. This should make it faster and more
          memory efficient.


1.02_03 Thu Jul 22 13:29:17 EDT 2004
        - Additional bullet proofing for joins. 
          Now we default to ALIAS1 being "main"  (cubic@acronis.ru)

1.02_02 Tue Jul 20 13:06:06 EDT 2004
        - Fixed a join bug that mostly manifests as a 'Dependency chain'
          error on RT2.

1.02_01 Wed Jul  7 12:28:08 EDT 2004
        - magic _Object instantiation from cubic@acronis.ru
        - make SB::_Handle settable directly  (cubic@acronis.ru)
        - document the above

0.85 June 7 2003
