Revision history for Perl extension Jifty::DBI.

==> Forked into Jifty::DBI

*  Removed {{{ and  }}} fold markers. Patch from Ruslan

1.30_03 Thu Jun  9 01:35:49 EDT 2005
* Significant new tests from Ruslan Zakirov and Dave Glasser

* You no longer need to explicitly bless a DBIx::SearchBuilder::Handle subclass 
  
* Start of a major overhaul of the subclass API for DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record objects.
  A new "schema" method will define the data in _ClassAccessible and also generate database
  schema using DBIx::DBSchema. 

Fixes from Ruslan:

    * for numeric types, make the empty check be "null or 0", not "null or ''"
    * New search tests from ruslan
    * added an init_data method to t/utils.pl
    * CleanSlate doesnt init show_rows
    * CleanSlate doesnt clean _{open|close}_parens
    * get rid of stupid ifs in CleanSlate 
    * get rid of evals in _DoSearch and _DoCount, use Handle methods to control DBI error handling 
    * rewrite LoadByPrimaryKeys args handling to consistent with other Load* methods
    * report error when PK filed is missing in LoadByPrimaryKeys
    * fix warning in __Set methods when newvalue is undef
    * small code cleanups
    * test coverage grows from 75.2% to 84.7% for Record.pm


1.30_02 Sun May 22 15:21:19 EDT 2005

 - Lots of patches from Ruslan:

   First and main change is using of `goto &$AUTOLOAD` syntax, that helps
   avoid code duplication and hides AUTOLOAD sub from stack trace. I think 
   this also would help implement CompileAllAutoSubs method easier.
   
 - It's also one of the steps to better tests coverage.
   
 - Test coverage for Record.pm grows from 66% to 75.2%.
   
 - _LoadFromSQL never reported error when PK fields are missed. Fixed. 
   
 - fetchrow_hashref dies only when RaiseErrors is true, because we can 
   control this from Handle obj so we should die according to
   $Handle->RaiseErrors property. Fixed. 
 - When RaiseErrors is "false" then fetchrow_hashref returns undef and we
   should check $sth->err(see `perldoc DBI`). Fixed. 
   
 - After call to fetchrow we should clean "fetched" internal hash and fill 
   it only when we return successful result. Fixed.
   
 - If SimpleQuery fails, _LoadFromSQL method doesn't return any error
   message. Fixed.

1.30_01 Mon May 16 21:37:03 BST 2005

    - Patches from Ruslan to switch to using 'capitalization.pm' for our regular_case subroutine aliases

1.27 Sun May  8 22:49:30 EDT 2005

    - Added supoprt for functions containing "?" to represent the parameter
        in ->Column()
    - Added better support for functional columns in search listings and
      group by clauses

1.26 Sun Apr 17 19:22:23 EDT 2005
    - Added support for expression based left joins


1.25 Sat Apr  9 12:33:30 EDT 2005

    - Backed out a change introduced in 1.23 that caused table and column names
      to be quoted, causing Postgres to flip out.

1.24 Wed Apr  6 22:54:37 EDT 2005
    - Added a new "SearchBuilder::Unique" module for uniquifying search results

1.23
    - Now use DBI->quote_identifier to quote column and table names (Ruslan)
    - Test suite updates (Ruslan)

1.22 Mon Jan 24 07:42:46 EST 2005
    - Require encode since we require encode.

1.21
    - Oracle LOB handling caused us to corrupt item values on update.
    - Just before inserting things into the database, turn off their utf8 flag.
      The flag didn't have any positve impact _and_ it can take down
      recent DBD::Oracle releases. (This is a new failure in DBD::Oracle 1.16)


1.20 Tue Jan 18 08:24:15 EST 2005
    - Minor test suite fixes from Ruslan.

1.19 Sat Jan  8 18:22:59 EST 2005

    - Performing a search multiple times could result in multiple copies of
      records in a collection. Uncovered thanks to Kevin Chen and Alex Vandiver.

1.18
    - Release the changes from 1.17

1.17_03
    - Properly mark BLOB columns in UPDATE calls. (DBD::Oracle 1.16 broke without this)

1.17_02
    - Better handling of empty values for SB::Record::_Accessible. ( --Ruslan)


1.17_01
    - More record tests from Ruz

1.16 Thu Dec  9 23:49:39 EST 2004
    - Fixed a bug in D::SB::R::Cachable that could cause it to load the wrong row from the cache if you were loading
      by alternate keys and had since changed one of the attributes of a previous row.  This was unmasked by a
      bug that Ruslan Zakirov found in RT 3.3's custom field handling


1.15 Sat Nov 27 13:09:56 EST 2004
    - Fix a testsuite bug when DBD::SQLite isn't there


1.14
    - Silenced warnings about uninitialized warnings when inserting null cols
      into the database.
    - Started adding lowercase method name aliases
    - Minor refactoring of 'id' method for a stupid, tiny perf improvement
    - Refactoring of DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable for performance
      improvement
    - Added a FlushCache method to DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable.
    - Started to flesh out a...test suite
    - SearchBuilder now truncates strings before inserting them into character
      types in the database as mysql generally does. Additionally, it truncates
      things at utf8 character boundaries...as mysql does not.
    - Fix for an undefined record cache warning on load from Autrijus Tang
    - Major documentation cleanups --Simon Cavalletto
    - A few tweaks to the ::Record class to eliminate the
      hard-coding of the name of the id column --Simon Cavalletto

1.12
    - Better error handling for some query build failure cases
    - Corrected query builder for SQLite
    - More refactoring.

1.11

    - When loading an object whose "id" has been altered, as in the case of RT's
      "Merge" functionality, the wrong object was returned by the caching layer.
       Special casing for the "id" method was removed.


1.10

    - Identical to 1.10_05


1.10_05

    -   Reworked the _Accessible mechanism in DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record to
        remove a horribly crufty old caching mechanism that created a copy
        of the accessible hash for each and every object instantiated,
        sometimes quite slowly.


1.10_04 Mon Aug 30 17:33:18 EDT 2004


A query builder fix for an issue that bit RT2:

 Unsatisfied dependency chain in Joins Users_2 at /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder/Handle.pm line 965,  line 69.

Stack:
  [/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder/Handle.pm:965]
  [/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder.pm:326]

1.10_02 Thu Aug 26 13:31:13 EDT 2004

1.10_01 Thu Aug 26 00:08:31 EDT 2004
        - Reimplemented DBIx::SearchBuilder:::Record::Cachable
          to use Cache::Simple::TimedExpiry. This should make it faster and more
          memory efficient.


1.02_03 Thu Jul 22 13:29:17 EDT 2004
        - Additional bullet proofing for joins.
          Now we default to ALIAS1 being "main"  (cubic@acronis.ru)

1.02_02 Tue Jul 20 13:06:06 EDT 2004
        - Fixed a join bug that mostly manifests as a 'Dependency chain'
          error on RT2.

1.02_01 Wed Jul  7 12:28:08 EDT 2004
        - magic _Object instantiation from cubic@acronis.ru
        - make SB::_Handle settable directly  (cubic@acronis.ru)
        - document the above

0.85 June 7 2003
