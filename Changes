Revision history for Perl extension Jifty::DBI.

0.25 Tue Sep 12 23:52:45 BST 2006

 * cleaned up DSN generation. 
 * Allowed arbitrary parameter specification in DSNs
 * Corrected the method name "DSN" to "dsn" throughout.
 * ( If a user tries to load a record by columns that happen ot be foriegn keys, and values that are objects, do the right thing
 * Propery cache DBI::Record entries when aliased.
 * Fewer accessor calls.
 * Only apply filters if we have values fetched.
 * make passing a J:D:Collection as a value DTRT
 * Jifty::DBI::Schema - s/die/croak/ to aid debugging.
 * Refactor Jifty::DBI::Filter::Date to be a subclass of ::Filter::DateTime.
 * New ::Filter::Time filter for time of day. ('time' sql type).
 * Update to Module::Install 0.64 to fix auto_install() when Makefile.PL is
   run from the command line and CPANPLUS is not installed.
 * The number of fixed tests in t/10schema.t for Jifty::DBI was wrong.
 * documented limit a bit more
 
 * JDBI::Filter::Date clones dates before setting timezone, so that we
   don't alter the object we're passed.
 * Spelling fixes.
 * Remove the @ISA-mocking code from Jifty::DBI::Schema, so that
 
     use MyApp::Record schema {
         ...;
     }
 
   can work even if MyApp::Record overrides Jifty::Record's column
   building methods.  We do that by arranging the schema callback
   to run after the @ISA chain is set up.
 
 * Jifty::DBI::Schema - defer initialization for columns created via the
  schema{} wrapper, so that users can continue to define column names
  that overlaps with the helper functions, such as "label" and "type".
 * attempt to test "label" and "type" column definitions.
   however, as I don't have Pg, I cannot run this test; help welcome.
 
 * cleaned up case sensitivity code
 * fixed SQLite docs
 * abstract out checking whether it's possible to make a clause case 
    insensitive so that subclasses of Handle can use those tests
 * doc'd Filter::DateTime special behavior when the column type is 'date'
 * Adding a filter to salt and hash passwords
 * Adding an after_set hook to Jifty::DBI::Record
 * Jifty::DBI::Schema: Lift the restriction to use another ::Schema
   package on the record model class; you can now directly write:
 
     package Wifty::Model::Page;
     use Jifty::DBI::Schema;
 
     schema {
     # ... your columns here ...
     };
 
   because &schema will unregister all symbols exported by Jifty::DBI::Schema
   after it runs the column initialization code.  Backward compatibility is
   preserved -- as long as you don't name your record model "Schema"...
 
 * update the testmodels.pl to use new schema decl syntax
 * Lift the call of schema to BEGIN time:
 
 * fixed handling of case sensitivity and numeric columns so opertions 
   like '>' do numeric instead of lexical comparisons
 * Allow collection SELECTs to have preload_columns defined.
 * Case insensitive searches should be, euh, case insensitive in Pg
 * Mark case-sensitive tests as TODO for MySQL
 * drop ::Cachable::new as it does nothing
 * add cache tests: columns names are case insensetive so we should
   generate cache key insenstive too
 ::Cachable::_gen_record_cache_key
  * hash key couldn't be undefined, but '' and 0 are different keys
  * values undef, 0 and '' are different, use '__undef' only when it's
    really undef
  * apply the same logic when $value is hash reference
  * use lower case for key part
  
 ::Cachable::load_from_cache
  * don't generate PK cache key, we do that in subcequent _store call
 
 ::Cachable::__set
  * don't create local arguments hash, just pass @_ throught
 
 ::Cachable::__delete
  * don't eat arguments, may be somebody wants to subclass
    and pass arguments to delete.
 
 ::Cachable::_fetch 
  * fetch again only when we found something in cache with
    keys' aliases
 ::Cachable::_primary_record_cache_key
  * avoid check for $self->id definess as if it's undef then
    record couldn't have pk cache key
  * use $self->primary_keys to get columns of the PK and its
    values, as result we get support for compound PKs here
 
  * Mark undef PK loading as TODO

  * Only mark the one failing test under mysql as TODO
 
  * make Collection smart about guessing table names
 
  * removed a lie from create() pod
  * Make _open_paren and _close_paren into public methods open_paren and close_paren

0.24 Tue Aug  8 23:33:34 EDT 2006
 * artificial version increment

0.23 Thu Jun 15 14:12:20 CEST 2006
 * Add tests for case sensitivity in limits
 * Caching for columns and readable/writable attributes. Only gains us 2% performance. But hey. 2% free
 * Added DateTime::Format::Strptime to requires
 * Do fewer ->COLUMNS calls from ->column, and do fewer ->column calls from
->value.
 * Make Jifty::DBI::Record::_init() expect a hash like Jifty::Record does
 * Fixes 'is_distinct' failure when used in Jifty
 * Use Class::Accessor::Fast.
 * Remove Carp::cluck, as it  hates END and vice versa.
 * Integrate today's hack for dumping callers for sql queries in question.
 * Add tests for case sensitivity in limits
 * Integrate today's hack for dumping callers for sql queries in question.
 * Enforce mandatory things at a Jifty::DBI layer
 * Cleanup 'distinct' column check and tests
 * Tests for column constraints 'mandatory' and 'distinct'
 * Implement support for 'distinct' column checks
 * Perltidy
 * Set validator on the column to validate_whatever (even if it's just
   the autogenerated one)
 * Update Module::Install to 0.21+ to prevent make loop; also
   avoid the use of "our" in VERSION strings for compat with
   older MMs. (Ditto with the previous commit)
 * Oracle fixes from Mark Gardner
 * Jifty::DBI::Filter::Storable - Do not die when the storable image is somehow
   corrupt; instead, simply return undef.
 * upgrade inc/ trees to 0.62+ to reflect the version::vpp fix.
 * Jifty::DBI::Collection - minor POD style and typo fix.
 * add_record now works on empty collections

 * t/01-version_checks.t - test for CPAN VERSION parsing hang-ups
 * lib/Jifty/DBI/Record.pm - added Class::ReturnValue's to disallowed accessors
 * lib/Jifty/DBI/Record.pm - do not try to set_<foo>() a collection
 * t/11schema_records.t - added tests for trying to set a collection
 * t/10schema.t - silence undef warning
 * lib/Jifty/DBI/Record.pm - catch attempts to set a refers_to
 * lib/Jifty/DBI/SchemaGenerator.pm - crediting myself per Jesse's suggestion :-O (ewilhelm)
 * lib/Jifty/DBI/SchemaGenerator.pm - pod edits:
   Redid synopsis with real example -- 
    maybe somewhat incorrect WRT Model::Schema, but it does work.
   Stripped boilerplate sections.
   Clarified add_model $model requirement.
   Cleanup odd =for public... pod bits.
   Spelling fix.
 * lib/Jifty/DBI/Handle.pm - documentation fixes/cleanup
 * created an api to allow distinct toggling


0.21 Wed May  3 14:14:41 EDT 2006

* We no longer do a count when setting up a collection's pager object by default
* order_by now returns the current orders
* added a "do_search" method to force a search, say before a count
* Added a filter for Dates, lib/Jifty/DBI/Filter/Date.pm

0.19 Sun Apr  2 18:59:53 JST 2006

* Columns now have a "sort_order" attribute. This way when auto-rendering
  forms, we can render them by "order defined" rather than just alphabetically.
    - idea by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa
